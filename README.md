# Aptos-Grade-blockchain
GradeChain is a blockchain-based student grading system built on the Aptos blockchain. The project enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof storage of student grades. Unlike traditional centralized systems, this solution gives students ownership of their academic records while allowing teachers to maintain a controlled and verifiable registry.
